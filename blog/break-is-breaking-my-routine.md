title: Break and a lack of productivity
date: 11/26/23

I'm not sure if it's just me, but every time a university break (ex. Thanksgiving break) hits, I end up collapsing as soon as I get home and end up doing no work despite my best intentions. I wake up tired despite getting 9-11 hours of sleep, can't seem to focus on anything that requires abstract thought or reasoning, and end up wasting hours watching Youtube or some random movie. (My mom keeps insisting that it's not wasted time though since people need to relax.)

Perhaps it's psychological.

Perhaps it's the environment.

Perhaps it's me falling back into my established patterns and habits at home.

Or, perhaps, it's because my brain finally realizes how tired it is when I finally give it a chance to rest for more than an hour.

Anyways, I'm back at school today, after doing work for 80% of the bus ride there. It's the most productive I've been since break - I'm not sure why. (this is why there's no actual post today. But I still have to post something lol)

Also, inspired by the movie Everything Everywhere All at Once, I've taken it upon myself to do at least one statistically improbable action every day in hopes of jumping to a more interesting variant of reality. idk maybe it works like that?
