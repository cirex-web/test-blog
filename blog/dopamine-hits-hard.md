I'm irrational.

Or rather, because my brain is just wired to hit that high, I'm able to waste 6 hours and 38 minutes today playing an online multiplayer game (kind of like diep.io) instead of doing actually useful and fulfilling things. Why? Because it just feels *so great* when you win an 8-player FFA match and see your rating go up by an arbitrary ε number of points at the end. [1] The feedback loop is practically immediate (each match is only a couple of minutes long), and because of the fast-paced nature of the game, it's incredibly difficult to stop playing during a match. And when the match ends, the sudden urge (and ease!) to press that looming *Play Again* button that's taking up half the screen doesn't help either. Much like a rat that runs through charged electrical wires to get another hit of dopamine, I found myself unable to stop despite being aware (!) of the hours that I was losing. It wasn't even about *just one more game*. I had no plans on stopping. It was just more matches and more dopamine. [2] Again. Again. And again. The desire to get another win somehow overrode all sense of inhibition and discipline. I had a schedule for today, but this hecking game threw it out the window.

Dopamine is wild, and I'm a fool for forgetting that I'm still susceptible to the same addictions as everyone else. After hours of convincing myself that I had it under control. I concluded that I had no self-control and *finally* added the site to my growing perm-banned list in Cold Turkey Blocker. With that out of the way, I found the time to write this half-baked piece of a blog. (I had a much more interesting topic planned, but oh well. Maybe next week.)

But isn't life just a series of highs and lows? Video games (and drugs) just happen to excel at condensing that high into a very, very short period of time. I dare say that we probably wouldn't do anything if it didn't give us dopamine. Or if we *feared* inaction. It all comes down to the avoidance of pain and the pursuit of pleasure, doesn't it? No higher meaning exists, no other-worldly purpose exists for us pathetic flesh-and-bone creatures.

Because we're all just hormones and stuff.

[1] I am ranked ~6k now. No idea if that's good or bad. I hope it's bad.

[2] I actually ended up analyzing the top-ranked players' matches to intuit some kind of strategy, which unfortunately just got me more hooked on the game once I could win more.
