Tis' the creation of a new blog... I'm not sure why I'm starting this, but I feel the _need_ to do so.

The plan is that I'll post a full-length post (whatever that means) once per week. If I don't, I'll have to pay $5 to Beeminder. lol

Everything may look really jank right now, but I'll fix this in a few days.

Oh and this is markdown transpiled into HTML, which is nice.
