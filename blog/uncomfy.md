title: [outline] Pursuing discomfort to the point of discomfort
date: 1/7/24

This is just an outline - will flesh this out tomorrow

I have this problem.

- Whenever I see an opportunity to do some socially uncomfortable thing, I immediatelly have an urge to do it.

  - Talking with strangers, asking someone some bizarre question, chatting up the employees working at the place I'm currently in, etc.

- Problem is, sometimes the situation's so uncomfortable that I just won't do it. (_Weird_ for me or the other person, or maybe risky given that I don't know people. _stranger danger? Is this even still a thing?_) At this point, I'll probably have a ~35% chance of actually comitting and doing it. But if I don't do it, the feeling of doing it won't go away. It doesn't matter if I'm with friends, if I'm with my parents, or if I'm alone. It's going to be in the back of my mind.

- If I don't do it, I'll feel horrible inside.

  - It'll always be there. I can try to rationalize myself not to do it, but I find that my brain just ends up saying something along the lines of _are you a pussy??? Are you a pussy? Stop making excuses because you're scared!_ And honestly, I'm not sure how I can convince myself otherwise. Anyways, I just kind of end up in a state of either total paralysis or take action. Either way, it feels very uncomfortable and stressful.

    - > I can't sit idly no I can't move at all.

  - The feeling doesn't go away when the uncomfortable opportunity disappears. In fact, it just turns into full-on regret. _Why didn't I talk to that one person about that whatever thing? I have unconditionally failed life._ More regret than if I had wasted a few hours online.

  - Regret can last for days, even weeks at times. (Go through some examples)

- Why?

  - What strikes me as particularly interesting is that this kind of mind-badgering and regret only appears to 1) uncomfortable and 2) social situations. And 3), this problem only started a few weeks ago.

  - At the start of CMU, there were a lot of opportunities to talk to people. As I was naturally introverted, I missed a decent amount of these such things (including going up to people at booths and meeting new friends in the dining area.) Thus, I concluded that in order to actually seize the moment and not let my life be controlled by social anxiety, I would put myself in at least 1 uncomfortable social situation per day. Like all other things that I hold myself accountable to, I put a committment on Beeminder. This was 8/26, a Saturday, just two days before the first day of classes.

    - > I put $5 on the line through an app called Beeminder... Why? Life is full of fleeting opportunities, moments throughout the day that require just a bit of courage or tenacity to pursue.

    - > Seizing the opportunity with $5 at stake (10/8/23)

  - If you read the full excerpt on the bottom, you can see it's filled with positive energy,

  - Two months in, I stopped because I had essentially "conquered" the daily uncomfortable things and going out of my comfort zone now would require significant effort on my part to create that discomfort (ex. pitching some absurd idea in front of an entire lecture hall of students, which I did do twice in fact.)

- Okay fine, but why am I so scared now? And instead of being a positive thing, why has this obsession turned into a net-negative?

  - 1. My confidence disappeared, but instead of an eagerness/excitement when I improve/strive to get out of my comfort zone, it's just regret when I don't.

       1. This kinda feels like what happened with CP (competitive programming). I fell off the improvement cycle at the end of junior year, and every time I tried to get back on I would basically criticize myself for doing it far worse that what I was doing in the past. Solved problems didn't feel like achievements ("you could've solved that way better last year!") and unsolved problems just meant that I was a failure and have regressed way too much. ("I definitely could've solved that before!") All this negative energy did not help, and it was probably one of the reasons I quit CP senior year.

    2. I'm already siezing the important conversations and now my brain just fixates on the non-important ones cuz I still fail those.

       1. Beeminder has created some habitual loop in my brain. Oh look, uncomfortable situation? GO go go!@!!!!!

       2. I guess just kinda ignore myself then? Like bro chill you don't need to try so hard.

> It turns out that all you need to get the confidence to talk to people was \$5. Just two weeks ago, I committed to a goal that I needed to do at least one uncomfortable thing a day. I put $5 on the line through an app called Beeminder, and started getting completely out of my comfort zone on day 1. Why? Life is full of fleeting opportunities, moments throughout the day that require just a bit of courage or tenacity to pursue. It was precisely opportunities like these that I kept shying away from, scared of stepping out into the unknown, of initiating conversations, of meeting strangers. Surprisingly, with the fear of losing money in the back of my mind, these daunting tasks suddenly became more approachable. Sure, sometimes they were still hard, sometimes they were uncomfortable. But I’ve also met a lot more people and learned a lot more things than I would’ve. I’ve gotten an invitation to go to the gym with someone simply because I asked “how they got so buff,” and have had my own private concert after asking a student sitting with a guitar on campus if he knew how to play Ed Sheeran.

> Not only that, I’ve now come to realize that things that had previously been formidable, like initiating conversations with strangers or asking for absurd things, now seemed exciting. The fear was replaced by eagerness, excitement for the possibilities ahead. With this confidence, I began making eye contact more. I began remembering people’s faces, asking bolder questions, and became more outgoing and sociable. (As a CS nerd, this is significant progress.)
