There are certain vibes to things. At CMU, it's just a work vibe. Full of (artificial) energy, full of potential, full of hope, full of dreams, full of discomfort, full of uncomfortable thoughts. At home, it's cozy, warm, and comforting. I just got home a few hours ago, and I practically just want to surrender myself to everything within. To hide within these walls in safety, in peace. Hakuna matata. CMU was just a bad dream I had - this is peace, this is life. Anyways, I don't really have time to make a full-fledged post, but here is an outline I made yesterday:

The Meaning of Life

- Meaning of life is people
  
  - When the world ends, all you want to hold on to is others. (or pray to God, whomever that is.) Not money, not some trophy or achievement or diploma

- Why work?
  
  - To benefit others?
  
  - To benefit yourself?
  
  - Why study mercilessely at a university when you could be hanging out with people? Why dive into the readings of dead philosophers on what it takes to *live* a morally correct life when you could just live it yourself?
  
  - Why learn how to find the determinant of a matrix with PA = LU factorization or prove an equivalence relation? I can't see where this goes, but maybe you just got to connect the dots backward. 

- So what to extrapolate from this? Where to go from here?
  
  - If that's the case, it seems reasonable to just exist with people 24/7, to hang out with them, maximize the quality of people-time no matter how you choose to do it?
  - Yes... So over spring break, hanging out with my parents is going to be the highest priority. Everything else is secondary (except maybe sleep and exercising, because I can't survive without either.)

- How I'm doing
  
  - "I don't know"
  
  - I feel nothing inside, no joy, perhaps pangs of mild sadness or guilt or longing or tiredness from just *existing*. 
  
  - Will tomorrow ever come? Will I make it through the night?  
    Will there ever be a place for the broken in the light?  
    Am I hurting? Am I sad? Should I stay or should I go?  
    I've forgotten how to tell, did I ever even know?
