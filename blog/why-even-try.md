title: Happiness is ephemeral

I don't know what to do with my life.

According to what I've found on YouTube (sources: nigahiga, mrbeast, and some random osu! player interviews + some CP guru advice.) and this book called "Homo Deus,"

Fame can't make you happy.

Wealth can't make you happy.

Being the best can't truly make you happy. (But I suppose it can leave you bored.)

Achieving any goal of any kind can't make you happy for an extended period of time because you'll have already gotten used to the state that you were aiming for by the time you progress enough to reach that state. And when you reach that goal, you'll find that your mind will fixate on new goals past the horizon instead.

Actually, nothing can make you happy forever. Happiness is fleeting, because it's just a bunch of chemicals in your brain. Falling in love with someone? Just chemicals. Getting promoted or a good grade doesn't make you happy - it's the chemicals in your brain (in response to that external stimuli) that do. And chemicals dissipate over time. (If they didn't, we wouldn't have drug addicts.)

Okay, fine, what about fulfillment then? Does that lie deeper than baseless happiness? Is there some fundamental and non-fleeting feeling that one can get from doing certain things? I'm not sure, but it doesn't seem plausible. After all, it's about the journey, not the destination. We undertake things because they're fun (at least sometimes) or if the goal provokes a sense of happiness or excitement. We wouldn't do things otherwise. (Unless inaction causes fear, which is the same as saying that doing the action makes you feel less worse.)

Just a quick rant today.

(Never being satisfied helps society progress I guess, so it's not bad?)
